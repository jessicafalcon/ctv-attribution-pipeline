# DECISIONS.md — why-not-X log

One entry per non-obvious choice. Newest last.

## Phase 0

- **Redpanda's built-in schema registry, not a separate container.** Redpanda
  ships the registry in the same binary on port 8081. A separate
  Confluent-style registry container would add a JVM (banned) and a second
  thing to health-check for zero benefit at this scale.
- **`docker compose up -d --wait` for `make up`.** `--wait` blocks on every
  service's healthcheck, which satisfies "health checks, not sleeps" with no
  wrapper script.
- **All image tags pinned.** `latest` would make `make up` behave differently
  across machines/dates — a determinism-policy violation at the infra layer.
- **No runtime Python dependencies in Phase 0.** The allowlist packages
  (bytewax, clickhouse-connect, …) are added in the phase that first imports
  them, so each PR's dependency delta is reviewable.
- **ClickHouse native port (9000) not published to the host.** Everything we
  run from the host uses clickhouse-connect over HTTP (8123); in-network
  services can still use 9000. Avoids a common host-port collision.
- **`run-tests` hook wiring is local-only** (gitignored
  `.claude/settings.local.json`), inherited ruling from trial-signal-assistant:
  a committed settings.json would auto-execute an inbound PR branch's hook +
  pytest + conftest.py for anyone opening it in Claude Code.
- **Redpanda healthcheck uses `rpk cluster health -w -e`, not output grep.**
  The flags make health an exit code (0 when healthy; blocks past the
  timeout when not), so an rpk text-format change can't silently break
  `make up`.
- **Compose ports bind 127.0.0.1** (security-review finding): the stack runs
  passwordless local-dev services (ClickHouse default user, Grafana
  admin/admin, Redpanda admin API); binding to localhost keeps them off the
  LAN. In-network services are unaffected (compose DNS).
- **GitHub Actions pinned by tag, not SHA** — accepted for now: this CI
  holds zero secrets. Revisit (SHA-pin) before the Phase 3 integration job.
- **`tests/test_smoke.py` instead of a truly empty suite.** Bare `pytest`
  exits 5 on "no tests collected", which would make `make test` red; one
  layout assertion keeps the suite meaningfully green.

## Phase 1

- **Schema registration via stdlib urllib, not confluent-kafka's
  schemaregistry extra.** Registration is one POST per subject; the extra
  pulls httpx/authlib/etc. (not on the allowlist) to do the same thing.
  Validation on produce is done by the pydantic models the schemas were
  generated from, so the contract enforced is identical.
- **Profiles are JSON, not YAML.** YAML would add a dependency; JSON is
  stdlib and profiles are small flat config.
- **Counter IDs (`e-000042`) and a fixed profile `sim_start`, no UUIDs or
  wall clock.** Byte-identical output per seed is the phase's core
  guarantee; any wall-clock or entropy source breaks it. Readable IDs also
  make fixture diffs debuggable.
- **Emit order = arrival order (sorted by `ingest_time`), duplicates
  re-sent later with identical bytes.** Mirrors how a real stream hits the
  broker: late events appear late in the stream, duplicates are true
  re-sends. Gives the engine (Phase 5) realistic input for lateness and
  dedup without extra machinery.
- **Single-partition topics at tiny scale.** Keyed partitioning is already
  in place (household_id / device_id); partition count is the documented
  scaling lever (ARCHITECTURE.md), and one partition keeps cross-partition
  ordering out of fixture comparisons.
- **Co-view multiplier = per-genre factor on the caused-conversion rate.**
  Simplest producer-side meaning that creates genre-skewed conversion
  volume for the read-time co-view factor and Phase 8's multiplier-bug
  fault to work against.
- **`data/out/<profile>/` mirror of every produced payload.** Byte-identity
  across runs and against `fixtures/tiny/` becomes a `diff -r`, with no
  topic-consuming harness needed in Phase 1. Truth links are NOT in the
  mirror (they are never produced to a topic); they live only under
  `data/truth/`, with a committed golden copy in `fixtures/tiny/` for eval.
- **Duplicate re-sends carry the original `ingest_time`.** A duplicate is
  the same bytes sent again, so its payload cannot record its later
  arrival. Consequence for later phases: `ingest_time − event_time`
  understates a duplicate's true arrival lateness. Lateness metrics
  (Phase 5+) must be computed on first-seen events, after dedup.
- **`tiny` stays inside the 7-day hot window (max lateness 3h).** Phases
  2–4 prove hot-path correctness on it, so every event must be attributable
  without reconciliation. Days-late arrivals (ARCHITECTURE: "minutes to
  days") are exercised by the `medium`/fault profiles from Phase 5 on —
  the late-injector knob already supports it; `tiny` deliberately doesn't
  use it.
- **Unknown-device conversions (`unknown_device_fraction`).** Without them
  every conversion's device is in the graph, device resolution is always
  correct, and Phase 2's IP-fallback and ambiguous-fan-out branches — plus
  the pipeline's headline failure mode, the shared-IP wrong-household
  match — are unreachable by construction. The unknown device draws its IP
  from the true household (same home network, unrecognized guest/roommate
  device): realistic, and it keeps shared IPs the sole source of
  wrong-household ambiguity. The truth link still records the true causing
  exposure, so a fan-out to the wrong household is measurable in Phase 4.
  `u-` ids are a namespace disjoint from graph `d-` ids. tiny is curated
  (fraction 0.3, seed 42) so the frozen fixture reaches all three resolve
  cases; a structural test pins that.
- **Phase 3 forward-note: assert against ReplacingMergeTree FINAL, not the
  raw stream.** tiny carries duplicates and hour-late arrivals, but
  Phase 3's engine is spec'd in-order/no-dedup (dedup lands in Phase 5). A
  duplicate conversion is processed twice on the hot path; both writes
  share `conversion_id`, so ReplacingMergeTree collapses them. The Phase 3
  integration test must compare FINAL (or argMax) state to truth, else it
  counts conversion-processings instead of conversions.
- **Review-driven hardening (Phase 1 review gate).** Delivery callbacks +
  checked flush (a partially delivered seed now fails instead of exiting
  0), `enable.idempotence` on the producer, request timeout + scheme check
  on schema registration, profile-name allowlisting in `load_profile`,
  min≤max validators and timezone-aware `sim_start` in the profile schema,
  `uv sync --locked` in CI, and a structural test that pipeline-stage code
  never mentions truth links.
